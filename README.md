## 🚀 About the Project

This portfolio is more than just a showcase of projects; it's a demonstration of skills in UI/UX and modern frontend development. The design features a **deep space dark theme**, floating elements, animated meteors, and a responsive layout that shines on any device.

### ✨ Visual Highlights
- **Space Atmosphere**: Deep space background with animated stars and meteors.
- **Interactivity**: Hover effects, `text-glow`, and smooth transitions.
- **CSS Animations**: Floating elements (`float`), subtle pulsing, and smooth entries.
